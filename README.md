Virtual Xerox <br/>
1. A spring boot and opencv python integrated application <br/>
2. Submit any image file and it would generate a virtual photocopy/xerox of that image.<br/>
3. The opencv python script is used to convert the image to the photocopy form and I have run the python file from the spring boot project itself!.<br/>
